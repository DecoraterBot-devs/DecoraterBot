*The commands below are from p[lugins. They might be moved to an markdown file in another github repository or branch depending on what we decide to place plugins that are not loaded on bot's startup by default. From now on all new bot commands are going to be added via plugins so they should be optional to install. (excluding the commands to be able to install plugins. Those would have to go into the main commands core file that contains the reloading functionality of normal commands and able to load, unload, and reload plugins.*
