### Setting credentials.db

- run ``git clone https://github.com/DecoraterBot-devs/credentials.git``
- follow the instructions in the ``README.md`` file in that cloned repository.

After that, you should obtain ``credentials.db`` file that you can then place at the root of the bot with ``DecoraterBot.py``.
