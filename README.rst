Submitting Plugins
------------------

repository. Submit them to

pull request instead.

Configuration
-------------

I recommend using ``git clone --recursive <repo>`` on this bot’s
repository to get the submodules to this bot.

To run this bot you will need 2 things:

   A working Discord Bot Token.

..

   Your Account ID

Configuration is in ``\\resources\\ConfigData\\``.

Before setting configuration be sure to copy
``Credentials_example.json`` to ``Credentials.json``.

More Documentation on setting that file is `here </Credentials.md>`__.

After you have configurated the bot with a token you can run the bot
like so:

Windows
=======

First install dependencies with (will also upgrade pip, setuptools, and
wheel for you as well):

   py -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Now you should be able to run the bot with:

   py -m DecoratorBot

Linux and MacOS
===============

First install dependencies with (will also upgrade pip, setuptools, and
wheel for you as well):

   python3.11 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Now you should be able to run the bot with:

   python3.11 -m DecoratorBot

Other Platforms
===============

This bot should work on other platforms as well, provided that all the
dependencies work for it as well.
