## What is DecoraterBot?

DecoraterBot is an extendable Discord bot that is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). It is currently maintained and developed by @[AraHaan](https://github.com/AraHaan), @[DavidNeon](https://github.com/DavidNeon), and rarely @[JakesDen](https://github.com/jakesden).

## Commands

View the list of bot commands [here](https://github.com/DecoraterBot-devs/DecoraterBot-cogs/blob/master/Commands.md).

## Future Updates

The bot gets updated and tested regularly. Pushes are released when features are stable.

## Description

The ``description.rst.in``, ``description.rst``, and the ``description.html`` files are used to generate the bot's description [here](https://bots.discord.pw/bots/104976661711179776).

## Rewrites

This bot from time to time might go through some rewrites to fix major and minor bugs in code.

Because of such it might sometimes means that it drops support for other things.

A such major rewrite was the commands extension one and then soon after a rewrite yet again to drop support for Python 3.4.

The reason for dropping support for 3.4 is because Discord.py will do the same soon as well when 3.5 is released on Debian systems.

## Submitting Plugins

As of April 8th 2017 it is now not recommended to submit plugins to this repository. Submit them to [here](https://github.com/DecoraterBot-devs/DecoraterBot-cogs) as a pull request instead.

## Configuration

To run this bot you will need 2 things:

> A working Discord Bot Token. 

> Your Account ID

Configuration is in ``\\resources\\ConfigData\\``.

Before setting configuration be sure to copy ``Credentials_example.json`` to ``Credentials.json``.

More Documentation on setting that file is [here](/Credentials.md).

After you have configurated the bot with a token you can run the bot like so:

# Windows

> with ``DecoraterBot.bat`` that uses the version of python you have on the windows path environment variable.

Note: *Before running any of those above patch files you need to run this file below to install dependencies on your version of python you installed.*

> ``install_deps.bat`` installs dependencies on the version of python you have on the windows path environment variable.

# Linux

> with ``DecoraterBot-35.sh`` that uses the current installed Python 3.5 Interpreter.

> with ``DecoraterBot-36.sh`` that uses the current installed Python 3.6 Interpreter.

First things first you need to install to ensure you have ``libffi-dev`` installed. You will have to also install ``ffmpeg``.

Now you have to install all dependencies to the bot using these files (only after you install ``libffi-dev`` and ``ffmpeg``):

> install_deps-3.5.sh

> install_deps-3.6.sh

However you will also need to ensure you have the latest ``libopus`` installed.

# Other Platforms

This bot should work on other platforms as well, provided that all the dependencies work for it as well.
