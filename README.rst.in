## Commands

View the list of bot commands [here](/Commands.md).

## Future Updates

The bot gets updated and tested regularly. Pushes are released when features are stable.

## Rewrites

This bot from time to time might go through some rewrites to fix major and minor bugs in code.

Because of such it might sometimes means that it drops support for other things.

A such major rewrite was the commands extension one and then soon after a rewrite yet again to drop support for Python 3.4.

The reason for dropping support for 3.4 is because Discord.py will do the same soon as well when 3.5 is released on Debian systems.

## Configuration

To run this bot you will need 2 things:

> A working Discord Bot Token. 

> Your Account ID

Configuration is in Credentials.json in ``\\resources\\ConfigData\\``.

More Documentation on setting that file **coming Soon™**.

After you have configurated the bot with a token you can run the bot with 1 of the following ways:

# Windows

> with ``DecoraterBot-3.5.bat`` that uses the 32-bit version of the system installed Python 3.5 interpreter on windows.

> with ``DecoraterBot-3.6.bat`` that uses the 32-bit version of the system installed Python 3.6 interpreter on windows.

> with ``DecoraterBot64-3.5.bat`` that uses the 64-bit version of the system installed Python 3.5 interpreter on windows.

> with ``DecoraterBot64-3.6.bat`` that uses the 64-bit version of the system installed Python 3.6 interpreter on windows.

Note *Before running any of those above patch files you need to run one of these two batch files to install dependencies on your version of python you installed to* ``%SystemDrive\Python35``/``%SystemDrive%\Python35x64`` *for Python 3.5 or*  ``%SystemDrive\Python36``/``%SystemDrive%\Python36x64`` *for Python 3.6*

> ``install_deps-3.5.bat`` installs dependencies on to the 32-bit version of the system installed Python 3.5 interpreter on windows.

> ``install_deps-3.6.bat`` installs dependencies on to the 32-bit version of the system installed Python 3.6 interpreter on windows.

> ``install_deps64-3.5.bat`` installs dependencies on to the 64-bit version of the system installed Python 3.5 interpreter on windows.

> ``install_deps64-3.6.bat`` installs dependencies on to the 64-bit version of the system installed Python 3.6 interpreter on windows.

# Linux

> with ``DecoraterBot-35.sh`` that uses the current installed Python 3.5 Interpreter.

> with ``DecoraterBot-36.sh`` that uses the current installed Python 3.6 Interpreter.

First things first you need to install to ensure you have ``libffi-dev`` installed. You will have to also install ``ffmpeg``.

Now you have to install all dependencies to the bot using these files (only after you install ``libffi-dev`` and ``ffmpeg``):

> install_deps-3.5.sh

> install_deps-3.6.sh

However you will also need to ensure you have the latest ``libopus`` installed.

# Other Platforms

Not available yet.

Some of the other platforms however could easily be unofficially supported. Some of those platforms could be mingw on Windows or if you can get the bot to work on python 3.6.1 on cygwin that could work to. Note: you would then need to compile ffmpeg from source.

I need command line things to execute python 3.5.0+ (3.6.1 recommended).
You have any other platforms you want the bot to support?
Well send me it's sys.platform value. The only thing stopping me is a few lines of platform specific code.
