Because of such it might sometimes means that it drops support for other things.

## Submitting Plugins

As of April 8th 2017 it is now not recommended to submit plugins to this repository. Submit them to [here](https://github.com/DecoraterBot-devs/DecoraterBot-cogs) as a pull request instead.

## Configuration

I recommend using ``git clone --recursive <repo>`` on this bot's repository to get the submodules to this bot.

To run this bot you will need 2 things:

> A working Discord Bot Token. 

> Your Account ID

Configuration is in ``\\resources\\ConfigData\\``.

Before setting configuration be sure to copy ``Credentials_example.json`` to ``Credentials.json``.

More Documentation on setting that file is [here](/Credentials.md).

After you have configurated the bot with a token you can run the bot like so:

# Windows

First install dependencies with (will also upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel for you as well):

> py -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Now you should be able to run the bot with:

> py -m DecoratorBot

# Linux and MacOS

First install dependencies with (will also upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel for you as well):

> python3.11 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Now you should be able to run the bot with:

> python3.11 -m DecoratorBot

# Other Platforms

This bot should work on other platforms as well, provided that all the dependencies work for it as well.
