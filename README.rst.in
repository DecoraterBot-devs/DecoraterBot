## Rewrites

This bot from time to time might go through some rewrites to fix major and minor bugs in code.

Because of such it might sometimes means that it drops support for other things.

## Submitting Plugins

As of April 8th 2017 it is now not recommended to submit plugins to this repository. Submit them to [here](https://github.com/DecoraterBot-devs/DecoraterBot-cogs) as a pull request instead.

## Configuration

To get the cogs, run ``git clone https://github.com/DecoraterBot-devs/DecoraterBot-cogs.git cogs`` in the root of your current clone to the bot.
This is so that they can be imported properly by the utils package.

To run this bot you will need 2 things:

> A working Discord Bot Token. 

> Your Account ID

Configuration is in ``\\resources\\ConfigData\\``.

Before setting configuration be sure to copy ``Credentials_example.json`` to ``Credentials.json``.

More Documentation on setting that file is [here](/Credentials.md).

After you have configured the bot with a token you can run the bot like so:

# Windows

First install dependencies with (will also upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel for you as well):

> py -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Now you should be able to run the bot with:

> py -m DecoratorBot

# Linux and MacOS

First install dependencies with (will also upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel for you as well):

> python3.11 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

Now you should be able to run the bot with:

> python3.11 -m DecoratorBot

Cant install python 3.11? Try using ``.pyenv`` and tell it to install 3.11 for you (perfect also when you do not have root access and need to get the bot ready).
Note: This bot also may require the python's C include files to install packages containing extension modules if they do not offer a prebuilt wheel for them.

# Other Platforms

This bot should work on other platforms as well, provided that all the dependencies work for it as well.
