# Terms
The sections below are the terms to use the bot.
By using the bot you agree to these terms.

## Users of the bot must
- Not abuse the bot. Spamming commands as long as it's not the exact same command over and over is ok, however be mindful of ratelimits and others using the bot.
- Do not use the bot to make fun of others or for outright racism when using the ``say`` command. The bot reseves all right to log all usages of said command and to punish users if required (ban them from the bot).

## Data retension
- Unless otherwise specified data retained are user id's (not names) and stored data like bot currency, and usage logs from specific commands (to monitor for possible abuse).
- Any other data not specified above is never logged or retained. I try to do what I can to ensure minimal non-identifying data is stored.

## Other data
> **Warning** </br>
> This type of data log is planned to be removed at a later date.
- The bot currently logs (when debugging) all gateway events.
