<h1 id="what-is-decoraterbot">What is DecoraterBot???</h1>
<p>DecoraterBot is an extendable discord bot made in python that is
constantly going through changes when and all possible. It currently
contains features such as currency, moderation, nsfw, fun commands, and
commands such as checking the uptime and status of the bot.</p>
<p>It goes through many fixes and things that are planned.</p>
<p>The bot is open source and any and all commands can be edited or
removed at any time. New commands in the form of plugins can be added as
well via github. A plugin installation was originally in the works, but
after years of inactivity and then slash commands, I had no choice but
to cancel that plan. However, plugins can still be submitted to <a

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Any commands could break at any time from
discord.py updates. So, if you find no command or most commands not
working then that means that those commands use functions or methods
that got broken or removed or even renamed. It just takes time in case
of updates as I do not always use them all the time to make sure they
all work. There is a rewrite happening for fears that the discord.py
rewrite when released would crash the bot at any momentâ€™s notice.</p>

<h1 id="developer">Developer</h1>
<p>I would like to ask that if you enjoy the bot, consider pledging to
my patron on at least 5$ per month to help support the development of
the bot and to keep the bot running. <a
