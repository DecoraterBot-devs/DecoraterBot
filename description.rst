What is DecoraterBot???
-----------------------

DecoraterBot is an extendable discord bot made in python that is
constantly going through changes when and all possible. It currently
contains features such as currency, moderation, nsfw, fun commands, and
commands such as checking the uptime and status of the bot.

It goes through many fixes and things that are planned.

The bot is open source and any and all commands can be edited or removed
at any time. New commands in the form of plugins can be added as well
via github. A plugin installation was originally in the works, but after
years of inactivity and then slash commands, I had no choice but to
cancel that plan. However, plugins can still be submitted to
https://github.com/DecoraterBot-devs/DecoraterBot-cogs.

Rewrite
-------

   **Note** Any commands could break at any time from discord.py
   updates. So, if you find no command or most commands not working then
   that means that those commands use functions or methods that got
   broken or removed or even renamed. It just takes time in case of
   updates as I do not always use them all the time to make sure they
   all work. There is a rewrite happening for fears that the discord.py
   rewrite when released would crash the bot at any momentâ€™s notice.

Developer
---------

I would like to ask that if you enjoy the bot, consider pledging to my
patron on at least 5$ per month to help support the development of the
bot and to keep the bot running. https://www.patreon.com/decorater
